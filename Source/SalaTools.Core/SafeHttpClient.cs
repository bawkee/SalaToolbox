/// <summary>
/// This class conceals the OperationCanceledException thrown by the HttpClient base class. This is because
/// some frameworks and UI components ignore or truncate these exceptions. One of these is System.Reactive.
/// This implementation will throw a special HttpOperationCancelledException instead, because it's sometimes
/// very important to catch or at least log these as they could indicate network problems.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// When there are issues with the network (ethernet cables, routers, switches, WiFi, 3G, 4G etc.) the
/// HttpClient handles this by cancelling the request via its own cancellation tokens, resulting in this
/// exception. Thus, the only indicator of a faulty network is an otherwise benign OperationCanceledException.
